Changelog for package ubiquity_motor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.7.0 (2018-04-15)
------------------
* Add script to probe the robot for information
* Add Serial Protocol Documentation
  Fixes `#33 <https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/ubiquity_motor/issues/33>`_

0.6.1 (2017-11-12)
------------------
* Reset controller when time jumps (`#31 <https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/ubiquity_motor/issues/31>`_)
  Reset the controller and zero commanded velocity an unexpected time change occurs (such as by NTP).  This prevents unexpected robot motion.

* actually calling the function now
* added pid params (hopefully)
* added more unit tests
* added some more unit test coverage, b/c I spent half an hour on an avoidable wild goose chase
